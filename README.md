This is lm*graph*tfy, an interactive graphing tool to help decide and generate the right graph for the data you have.
The front end was built in JavaScript and uses ChartJS to make the graphs and Handlebars for templating the question tree. The back end was built with Ruby on Rails. Gifs provided by [The Cat API] (thecatAPI.com), for those who would rather not make a graph. Fork, clone, and npm install to install. 

This was a week-long open-ended final project for my General Assembly Web Development Immersive course. I split the front end into two sections, questions and graphs. The question section is a tree of objects that can be fed into the Handlebars template to update the view. The graphs section takes an object generated by the input fields, adds the necessary formatting to be recognized by ChartJS, and updates the canvas. A logged in user can save their graph to the gallery, and can edit and delete their saved graphs.

Future updates will include:
- Personal Galleries
- Social Sharing
